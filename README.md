# StemBerry
StemBerry is a python script that generates an interface and data collection tool for the SOCEM device, developed at the AgMEQ lab. Austin Bebee was the original author of StemBerry. I have further developed StemBerry for  what will hopefully be a streamlined data collection experience.
